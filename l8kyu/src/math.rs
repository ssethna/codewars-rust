/// Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to num.
/// The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0.
/// Your function only needs to return the result, what is shown between parentheses 
/// in the example below is how you reach that result and it's not part of it, 
/// see the sample tests.
pub fn summation(n: i32) -> i32 {
    n*(n+1)/2
}
